 In my extension, I used a DFS search based algorithm to find
 the strongly linked components of the data base I inputted.
 In my case, the data set I used is a record of retweets. The
 problem I solve is essentially how many people you can affect,
 or how many people can potentially see a single persons tweet.
 In the Higgs Boson sample, the largest SCC size was 984 and 
 in the combined twitters sample, the largest SCC size was
 68413. So in the Higgs Boson sample, roughly 984 people
 had some sort of tweet exchange between each other. Same for
 the combined twitter sample
I tested this sample by manually drawing out my graph, and performing
the algorithm by hand. Analyzing, how big the largest SCC was.
Of course, I could return the first COUPLE largest of SCC's but
that's not the problem I am trying to solve. I also found that
finding that largest SCC, in terms of twitter feed data, is probably
the more useless of the bunch of information.

 TO RUN:
 To run the code, just compile and execute with 
 './extension "file1"'
 with "file1" being the twitter file to analyze.
 I will upload the "small_text_graph.txt" file to test with.
